== Future development

In the terminology of agile development this OGC Abstract Specification (AS) is a "minimal viable product."  The model defined by the AS is intended to be suitable for the majority of current and proposed deformation models used for coordinate operations. However, during the course of its development a number of potential future enhancements were identified.  Some of these are discussed below.

=== Discontinuities in the displacement field

One difficulty with representing deformation using gridded models is that they cannot represent discontinuities in the displacement field such as occurs in areas of surface faulting.  There may be very large relative coseismic movement across a fault trace which may traverse one or more grids in the model.  There may be breaks between segments of a fault trace between which the ground is distorted in unpredictable and often unmeasurable ways.  

These displacements cannot be represented in a gridded model in which displacements are interpolated smoothly across each grid cell.  This is illustrated in <<image-fault-discontinuity>> showing a modeled horizontal displacement field.  The left-hand diagram shows the actual displacement in two grid cells.  A right lateral strike slip fault runs through the upper grid cell, shown by the gray line.  The right-hand diagram shows the displacement interpolated from the values at the grid nodes (red vectors).  In the cell containing the fault the interpolated displacement is very different from the actual displacement, whereas in the adjacent cell they are virtually indistinguishable.

Even if the deformation model were perfect, it might not be useful for transforming geographic features near a fault trace.  Following an earthquake there are many ways that spatial features may be changed - often not reflecting the exact deformation of the Earthâ€™s surface.  For example, the line of a cadastral boundary may be defined by legal considerations which override the physical movement of the ground.  A road crossing a fault trace may be physically realigned to remain usable.  These considerations cannot be accounted for by the deformation model.  In many cases data must be recaptured in such areas to restore spatial integrity.

It may be valuable for the users of deformation models to know when a transformed features is likely to be affected by large errors which cannot be represented in the model.  Conceptually, software would generate a warning to users.  For example, this would happen when transforming a feature spanning a fault trace and over a time range that includes the time of the earthquake.

Four mechanisms have been suggested that could either alert users to such a situation when they do conversions, or allow them to investigate when it could affect their work.  These mechanisms are as follows.

. Add metadata that defines the affected location and time.  This could be an area defined in a standard spatial format, such as well-known text (WKT), associated with a date or epoch attribute.  The spatial definition could be  either included in the deformation model metadata, or as an online resource referenced in the metadata.  This AS does not describe any standard for presenting such metadata.  It would be up to the user to identify and interpret it.
. Use a large uncertainty to indicate where there is likely to be a large difference between the interpolated and actual displacements.  While this can be used to indicate the approximate area affected by discontinuity, it is spatially imprecise. A large uncertainty value at a node affects all four grid cells surrounding the node.  This differs from the interpolation error, shown in <<image-fault-discontinuity>>, which affects only the grid cells containing the fault trace - adjacent cells are not affected.  Nonetheless this is an option available to producers, provided it is understood that it may overestimate the error in the vicinity of a fault trace.  
. Analyze the displacement vectors at the grid nodes in the implementation software.  Grid cells likely to be affected by large interpolation errors could be identified by analyzing the displacement vectors themselves.  A simple measure of this uncertainty within a grid cell is the maximum vector difference between any two of the displacement vectors at the four nodes of the cell.  For a grid cell spanning the fault trace, the displacement vectors for nodes on one side of the fault are in the opposite direction to those of nodes on the other side of the fault so there is a large difference between these vectors.  Conversely, for a grid cell to one side of the fault trace, the four displacement vectors are likely to have similar direction and magnitude, so the maximum difference between any two of these vectors is small.  This method requires special purpose software to analyze the grids and determine the affected grid cells.  The software would then have to  alert users when these cells were used in a coordinate operation.  A benefit of this approach is that it provides an indication of the magnitude of the potential error.
. Use an additional grid node attribute - a "flag" value that specifically identifies affected cells.  This is a Boolean value that is true or false.  There are several options for how this could identify the affected cell.  One option is to use a convention defining which node identifies a grid cell.  For example, the node on row i and column j could identify the cell between grid nodes on rows i and i+1 and columns j and j+1.  Another option is to set the flag as true on all nodes of an affected grid cell.  A grid cell is identified as affected only if the flag value is true on all four of its nodes.  Such an attribute would require special processing by software.

One difficulty with all these mechanisms is that coordinate operations are "black box" operations to most users - they often happen within software applications as data from different CRSs or different epochs are combined for analysis and presentation.  Often this will be done on remote servers presenting information to users in web browsers.  Users may not be aware that a coordinate operation is happening.  The mechanisms above would need extensive implementation in the spatial software stack for a warning generated in a coordinate operation to be presented to users in a meaningful way.  Given this practical difficulty, this AS does not explicitly specify how discontinuity should be handled.  

Although handling discontinuities is not defined in this AS, the first two of these options, using metadata and using uncertainty, are available to model producers already. 

The third method, analyzing the displacement vectors, can be used with any deformation model.  An approach like this could be developed in software for analyzing deformation models independently of coordinate operation software.  This is an area that may warrant further research once more deformation models, and particularly models incorporating coseismic displacements, become available for analysis.

=== Vector interpolation in polar regions

As noted in <<discuss-deformation-near-poles>>, this AS does not recommend the use of geographic CRSs (i.e. latitude/longitude) for deformation models close to the geographic poles.  In such cases, the horizontal displacement vector cannot be interpolated or applied correctly.  Early versions of this AS did include an alternative interpolation method, and an alternative method of adding horizontal displacements to a geographic coordinate.  In each case the method involved transforming the displacements to and from a geocentric Cartesian CRS.  

These were removed from the AS for two reasons:

. Currently there is no requirement for this capability, and  
. Further research should be undertaken before recommending specific methods.
