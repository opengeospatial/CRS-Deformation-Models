==== carrier

specific format used to encode a deformation model. +
Note 1 to entry: The carrier defines how the attributes of the deformation model are encoded. 

==== implementation

software that uses an encoded deformation model to calculate displacements and apply coordinate operations. +
Note 1 to entry: The implementation encodes the formulae defined in this specification or numerically equivalent formulae.

==== producer

agency compiling a deformation model for publication

=== Abbreviations

////
=== accessible CRS

A CRS within which positions can be measured directly?!

NOTE: Need a meaningful definition here.  Need to track this one down to its source.

[example]
The position used to calculate the spatial model is not defined in an currently accessible CRS

Geographic CRS
