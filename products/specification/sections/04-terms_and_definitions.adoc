producer:: An agency compiling a deformation model for publication
carrier:: A specific format used to encode a deformation model. The carrier defines how the attributes of the deformation model are encoded. 
implementation:: A software that uses an encoded deformation model to calculate displacements and apply coordinate operations.  The implementation encodes the formulae defined in this specification or numerically equivalent formulae.

=== Abbreviations
