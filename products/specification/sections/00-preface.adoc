[NOTE]
====
Give OGC specific commentary: describe the technical content, reason for document, history of the document and precursors, and plans for future work.

There are two ways to specify the Preface: "simple clause" or "full clasuse"

If the Preface does not contain subclauses, it is considered a simple preface clause. This one is entered as text after the `.Preface` label and must be placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc section title. It should not be give a section title of its own.

If the Preface contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as a full preface clause. This one is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section with te title "Preface", i.e. `== Preface`. (Simple preface content can also be encoded like full preface.)
