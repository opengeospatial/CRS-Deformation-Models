[NOTE]
====
Give OGC specific commentary: describe the technical content, reason for document, history of the document and precursors, and plans for future work.

There are two ways to specify the Preface: "simple clause" or "full clasuse"

If the Preface does not contain subclauses, it is considered a simple preface clause. This one is entered as text after the `.Preface` label and must be placed between the AsciiDoc document attributes and the first AsciiDoc section title. It should not be give a section title of its own.

If the Preface contains subclauses, it needs to be encoded as a full preface clause. This one is recognized as a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section with te title "Preface", i.e. `== Preface`. (Simple preface content can also be encoded like full preface.)

== Abstract

All objects on the surface of the earth are moving. Apparently fixed features such as buildings are moving with the earth's crust, being subject to ongoing plate tectonic movement and episodic deformation events such as earthquakes. Increasingly, we rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) which can precisely determine the coordinates of features - coordinates we then store and use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other spatial databases. However, the coordinates from GNSS are referenced to global reference frames and coordinate systems.  In these reference frames ongoing movement of fixed objects means that the coordinates of these features are continually changing over time. 

This creates a challenge for the geospatial and positioning community: how to account for this movement when comparing data sets observed at different times, or how to relocate an object located in the past.

One solution to this challenge is to use a deformation model - a mathematical model of the deformation of the crust. It allows the coordinates of a fixed object to be propagated to different times so that they track the object's location.

Common uses  of a deformation model include:

* determining the current location of an object based on historic measurement of its location, 
* transformation of the current observed location of an object to the reference epoch of a static coordinate system,
* determining the spatial relationship of data sets observed at different times,
* predicting the location of an object at some future time.

Currently, many national geodetic agencies construct deformation models. However, these  generally use customized formats and are typically only used by software developed by the agency.

This specification defines a framework for describing a deformation model. We call this framework a functional model.  It describes a way of parameterizing deformation such that it can be encoded into a data set and incorporated into software for use in coordinate operations. It also defines how to calculate the displacement of a point between two different epochs.
This specification allows producers of deformation models, such as national geodetic agencies, to publish these models in a consistent way. Users of software that performs coordinate operations, such as coordinate transformations, can be confident that the model is being applied as intended by the producers.

== Introduction

This specification has been developed by the OGC Coordinate Reference System (CRS) domain working group (DWG) in conjunction with the CRS DWG project team developing the "Gridded Geodetic Exchange Format (GGXF)" and with the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) Working group 1.3.1 on "Time-dependent transformations between reference frames in deforming regions".

This specification defines a general parameterization of deformation models as illustrated in <<image_structure>>.  The total deformation is decomposed into a set of elements, each of which is defined by a spatial function and a time function.  The spatial function defines the displacement that applies at a given location, and the time function defines a scalar function that applies for the element at a given time.  The displacement due to the element is the spatial function displacement multiplied by the time function scale factor.  The total displacement at the location and time is the sum of the displacements from each element.

Commonly, elements represent the effects of geophysical events, such as coseismic deformation due to an earthquake. However, an element could equally represent some measured displacement for which no physical cause has been ascribed. Also, several elements may represent different aspects of a single geophysical event.  For example, the horizontal deformation due to an earthquake may be represented by one element, and the vertical deformation by another.

Other types of deformation model not encompassed by this specification include:

* rigid body transformation between reference frames such as time dependent Helmert or Bursa-Wolf transformations, 
* trajectory models for individual points, such as ITRF reference station coordinate models, 
* static distortion models used to represent the difference between two datums,
* global plate tectonic models,
* three dimensional geophysical models of deformation in terms of dislocations on fault surfaces such as elastic half space or finite element models. 

Also, this specification does not describe how the parameters and metadata of a deformation model should be encoded into a digital file.

The intention of this specification is to allow deformation model producers, such as national geodetic agencies, to be confident that the models they provide are being used as they intended.  It defines the parameters that must be encoded to define a deformation model, and the formulae that must be used by software to calculate and apply the deformation to coordinates.
