This OGC Abstract Specification (AS) defines a functional model used to define deformation models - models of the ongoing deformation of the earth's crust - to support their implementation into coordinate operations.

For the purposes of this document a deformation model is defined as follows:
____
A deformation model is a model of the displacement of the earthâ€™s surface within a defined spatial and temporal extent.  The model predicts the location of a point fixed to the surface at any time within the temporal extent in terms of an accessible CRS.  The location of the point is represented as a displacement from a reference position for that point.
____

In the most abstract sense, a deformation model is a mathematical function of a two-dimensional coordinate and a time that defines a one-, two-, or three-dimensional coordinate displacement.  It may also express the uncertainty of the displacement.

This AS provides a framework for  representing a deformation model using a set of parameters and gridded data. The AS  specifies how the displacement is calculated from these data and how it is used in a  coordinate operation. The AS also specifies what metadata that should accompany the encoded model to allow users to understand its applicability and limitations.
