This abstract specification defines a functional model that is used to define deformation models - models of the ongoing deformation of the earth's crust - to support their implementation into coordinate operations and transformations.

Within this context a deformation model is defined as follows:
____
A deformation model is a model of the displacement of the earthâ€™s surface within a defined spatial and temporal extent.  It predicts the location of a point fixed to the surface at any time within the temporal extent in terms of an accessible coordinate system.  The position of the point is represented as a displacement from a reference position for that point.
____ 

In the most abstract sense a deformation model is a mathematical function of a two dimensional coordinate and a time that calculates a one, two, or three dimensional coordinate displacement.  It may also calculate the uncertainty of the deformation.  

This specification describes a means of encoding the deformation model into a set of parameters including gridded data and related coefficients that define this mathematical function.  It specifies how the displacement is calculated from these parameters and how it is applied to a coordinate to apply the coordinate operation that the deformation model supports.  It also defines metadata attributes that should accompany the encoded model to allow users to understand its applicability and limitations.
