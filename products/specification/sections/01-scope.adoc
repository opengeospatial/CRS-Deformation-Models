This abstract specification defines a functional model used to define deformation models - models of the ongoing deformation of the earth's crust - to support their implementation into coordinate operations and transformations.

For the purposes of this document a deformation model is defined as follows:
____
A deformation model is a model of the displacement of the earthâ€™s surface within a defined spatial and temporal extent.  It predicts the location of a point fixed to the surface at any time within the temporal extent in terms of an accessible coordinate system.  The location of the point is represented as a displacement from a reference position for that point.
____

In the most abstract sense, a deformation model is a mathematical function of a two dimensional coordinate and a time that defines a one, two, or three dimensional coordinate displacement.  It may also express the uncertainty of the displacement.

This specification provides a framework for  representing a deformation model using a set of parameters and gridded data. It specifies how the displacement is calculated from these data and how it is used in a  coordinate operation. It also specifies metadata that should accompany the encoded model to allow users to understand its applicability and limitations.
